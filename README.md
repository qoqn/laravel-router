# Laravel Router

This repository contains my personal automatic router for **Laravel**. It's a project I've been working on to automate routing based on my own development preferences. If you're interested, you're welcome to use it.

## Status and Inspiration

This is currently a **personal project** and is a work in progress. It was inspired by similar packages, particularly those from **Spatie**, a company known for its excellent Laravel packages.

## Documentation and Compatibility

At the moment, there is **no official documentation**. You'll have to explore the code to understand how it works.

Please note that this package may have **breaking changes** and is not guaranteed to be compatible with older versions of Laravel. It's highly recommended that you **pin the package version** in your `composer.json` file. For now, the version is set below `1.0`.
